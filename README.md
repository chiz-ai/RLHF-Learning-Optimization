# RLHF-Learning-Optimization

This repository explores the use of **Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF)** to optimize adaptive learning paths specifically for cybersecurity education curricula.

---

## 🚀 **Project Overview**
The project aims to design and evaluate adaptive cybersecurity educational experiences by leveraging RLHF. This approach incorporates human feedback directly into reinforcement learning to tailor learning paths and optimize educational outcomes.

## 🎯 **Current Goals**
- Develop synthetic learner environments to test adaptive learning paths.
- Apply RLHF techniques to enhance cybersecurity curriculum effectiveness.
- Evaluate learning path optimization compared to traditional educational methods.

## 🛠️ **Technologies Currently Used**
- Python, PyTorch, TensorFlow
- Reinforcement Learning frameworks: Stable-Baselines3, RLlib
- Synthetic learner environment creation (planned)

## ⏳ **Current Status**
- In progress; updates will be regularly provided.
